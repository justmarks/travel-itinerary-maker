## Features

- **Day-by-day itinerary view** — inline segment cards with editing, per-segment costs, and confirmation codes
- **Timeline view** — Hipmunk-style Gantt grid; toggle between swimlane rows (Transport / Hotel / Activities / Dining) and a single chronological row; hotel stays render as spanning bars; prints cleanly
- **Map view** — plot hotels, dining, activities, and transport endpoints as pins on an interactive Google Map; KML export for sharing with Google My Maps
- **Flight endpoints by IATA code** — flights store 3-letter airport codes (e.g. `JFK`, `NRT`) and render consistently as `City (CODE)` everywhere; the segment editor has a typeahead that searches 1,178 commercial airports by code, city, airport name, or alias (so "Tokyo" finds NRT) and the title auto-fills to `DEP → ARR (Carrier RouteCode)` once both endpoints are set
- **Sign in with Google or Microsoft** — Supabase Auth handles both providers; one account holds your trips regardless of which provider you used to sign in
- **Multi-provider email + calendar** — Connect Gmail or Outlook for email scanning, Google Calendar or Outlook Calendar for sync. Both providers can be linked on the same account; the picker in each sync / scan dialog defaults to whichever you used last
- **Postgres storage** (via Supabase) — trip data lives in your Supabase project's `trips` / `segments` / `todos` / `history` tables; encrypted refresh tokens stored alongside
- **Inline editing** — rename trips, add/edit/delete segments, manage TODOs and costs; one-click "Confirm all" for a whole batch of auto-parsed segments
- **Embedded costs** — each segment card shows cost and booking details inline, with a dedicated Costs tab
- **TODO tracking** — categorized checklist for meals, activities, research, and logistics
- **Sharing** — generate per-trip share links with configurable visibility (costs, TODOs), or set up an **auto-share rule** that shares every existing and future trip with someone in one tap
- **Trip history (audit log)** — every change to a trip (segments added / edited / deleted, todos checked, dates rolled, day cities edited, segment field-level diffs, shares created or revoked, XLSX or email-scan imports) is recorded in an append-only History tab showing what changed, who did it, and when. Reverse-chrono, grouped by day, capped at the most recent 500 entries per trip. Available to owners and contributors alike — particularly useful on shared edit-trips with multiple collaborators
- **Export** — download itineraries as Markdown, OneNote-compatible HTML, PDF, or **iCal (.ics)**; the iCal file is named after the trip, includes VTIMEZONE blocks for correct DST display in Outlook, and handles overnight flights (arrival date advances to the next calendar day when the flight crosses midnight UTC)
- **Google Calendar sync** — push all trip segments to any of your writable Google Calendars with one click; hotels and car rentals become all-day events; flights and trains carry the correct IANA time zone per city so events land at the right wall-clock time regardless of your device zone; re-sync updates existing events; unsync removes them (with a choice to delete the events from Google or just unlink); a calendar picker lets you choose which calendar before each sync; available on both desktop (trip-header overflow menu) and mobile (`/m` overflow menu)
- **Dark mode** — Light / Dark / System theme toggle in the user menu (desktop + mobile); follows your OS preference by default and persists your choice across sessions
- **Installable PWA + offline trips** — add the mobile site to your home screen (Android / iOS), launch into a standalone window, and read previously-loaded trips with no signal — critical for day-of airport use. The mobile trip list dims trips that haven't been loaded on this device when you're offline (with an "Offline — not loaded" badge) so you know at a glance what's safe to open before takeoff
- **Demo mode** — try the app with sample data via `?demo=true` (no sign-in required)
- **Email parsing** — auto-extract flights, hotels, restaurants from Gmail confirmations using Claude AI
- **Email file import** — paste or upload a saved `.html` or `.eml` message and run it through the same Claude parser (unblocks non-Gmail users)
- **XLSX import** — one-shot import a complete trip from a OneNote-exported workbook; auto-detects column layouts (B=date vs. C=date) and parses the Costs sheet, attaching costs to matching lodging segments

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 20
- **pnpm** 10.33.0 — enable via corepack:
  ```bash
  corepack enable
  corepack prepare pnpm@10.33.0 --activate
  ```

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/justmarks/itinly.git
cd itinly
pnpm install

# Configure environment
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# Edit server/.env: at minimum set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET for sign-in
# and DATABASE_URL + SUPABASE_URL for the auth + storage stack.
# See `docs/supabase-auth-setup.md` for the one-time Supabase /
# Azure app-registration setup the new auth path depends on.
```

### Development

```bash
# Start everything (frontend + backend + shared packages)
pnpm dev

# Or run individually:
cd server && pnpm dev       # Express API → http://localhost:3001
cd apps/web && pnpm dev     # Next.js → http://localhost:3000
```

The backend defaults to **memory mode** during development — no Postgres / Supabase credentials needed; data resets on server restart. Set `DATABASE_URL` to flip to Postgres mode. The frontend always talks to whichever backend is running on port 3001.

### Build

```bash
pnpm build    # Builds all packages in dependency order via Turborepo
```

### Test

```bash
pnpm test     # Run all tests across the monorepo

# Run specific packages:
cd server && pnpm test
cd packages/shared && pnpm test

# Run a single test file:
cd server && pnpm test -- --testPathPattern="trips.test"
```

Current coverage: **927 tests** across 58 test suites.

This line is kept fresh by `scripts/update-test-count.mjs`. Before opening a PR that materially changes the test count, run `pnpm update-test-count`. CI fails the build when the line is stale (`pnpm check-test-count`).

| Package | Tests | What's tested |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| `packages/shared` | 263 | Validators (incl. `html` / `eml` import schema branch and XLSX import schema, `provider` field on email scan request), date utils, currency formatting (including USD FX conversion), markdown + OneNote export, iCal export (VCALENDAR wrapper, TZID on flights, all-day hotels/car-rentals, VTIMEZONE DST offsets, overnight flight date advancement, floating datetimes, line folding, escaping), ID generation, segment label formatting, IATA airport lookup (code/city/name/keyword search, timezone resolution, normalisation), overlap detection, segment matching, meal suggestions, primary-location detection (bookend exclusion, asymmetric transfer days), trip schema migrations (incl. v1 → v2 history backfill), append-only trip-history helper (append, trim at 500, immutability), `sortByPrimaryEmail` stable-partition helper |
| `server` | 664 | Trip + segment + todo CRUD, sharing (incl. recipient self-leave: success path, cross-recipient denial, owner-revoke path unchanged), costs, export (markdown + OneNote + PDF + iCal), trip history audit log across all mutation paths (segment / todo / trip / share / day-city / bulk-import; field-level diffs; no-op writes record nothing), email scanning + match detection across **both** Gmail and Outlook (provider-agnostic contract + parser-agnostic regression + destination routing), HTML + EML import pipeline, `EmailParser.htmlToText` + `emlToEmail`, XLSX trip importer (B/C column-layout auto-detection, day-of-month carry-forward, year-hint inference + year shift, Costs sheet → lodging attachment, import route), Google Calendar **and** Outlook Calendar sync + unsync (all-day events for hotels/car rentals, timed events with IANA TZ for flights, cross-provider TZ + DST wire-format parity, update-preserves-unmodified-fields), auth routes, shared route, contributor edit flow (resolveTripAccess + sharedWithEmail index), `requireAuth` middleware (silenced 401 from Google for expired tokens), CORS origin allow-list + preview-pattern matching, rate limiting on `/emails/scan`, `EmailParser` (time normalisation, cost/URL sanitisation, hotel defaults, cruise portsOfCall), SupabaseStorage + InMemoryStorage (shared contract), DriveStorage (legacy), TokenStore, refresh-token AES-256-GCM encryption, ShareRegistry, ShareSnapshotStore (Edge-runtime unfurl previews) |

## Google OAuth Setup

> **New setups should use Supabase Auth** as the primary sign-in path —
> see [`docs/supabase-auth-setup.md`](docs/supabase-auth-setup.md) for
> the project + Azure-app-registration steps that unlock Google +
> Microsoft sign-in side-by-side. The instructions below configure the
> Google OAuth client itself (still required for Google sign-in and
> for the Calendar / Gmail API scopes Supabase forwards to Google).

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a project (or select existing)
3. Enable **Gmail API** and **Google Calendar API**
4. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials** → Create **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
5. Add authorized JavaScript origins:
   - `http://localhost:3000` (local dev)
   - Your Vercel origin (e.g., `https://project-yhbyn.vercel.app` or your custom domain)
6. Add authorized redirect URIs (Google bounces the user back here after consent):
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - `https://project-yhbyn.vercel.app/auth/callback` (or your production origin)

   You don't need to register Vercel preview URLs — they relay through production. See [docs/vercel-setup.md](docs/vercel-setup.md#oauth-on-preview-deployments).
7. Copy credentials into `server/.env`:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```
8. Set the frontend env var in `apps/web/.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   ```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Where | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `PORT` | server | Express port (default: `3001`) |
| `NODE_ENV` | server | `development` / `production` / `test` |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | server | Comma-separated list of allowed origins (default: `http://localhost:3000`) |
| `CORS_ORIGIN_PATTERN` | server | Optional regex (as a string) for dynamic origins. A request is allowed if its `Origin` matches any literal in `CORS_ORIGIN` **or** this pattern. Used to accept Vercel per-deploy preview URLs without re-listing every hash. Example: `^https://itinly-[a-z0-9-]+-justmarks-projects\.vercel\.app$`. Leave unset in dev. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | server | Google OAuth client ID |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | server | Google OAuth client secret |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | server | For Claude AI email parsing |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` | server **and** apps/web | Upstash Redis REST URL. Server uses it for token/share registry persistence; web reads it on the Edge runtime to render share unfurl previews. |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | server **and** apps/web | Upstash Redis REST token (server-only on web — set as a non-public Vercel env var). |
| `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | server | Hex-encoded 32-byte key (64 hex chars) for AES-256-GCM encryption of refresh tokens at rest. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. Unset = plaintext storage (fine for dev/tests, not recommended in production). See `docs/redis-persistence.md` for the rotation story. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | server | Postgres connection string. Required for Supabase-authed users (Phase 3b+) — without it, signed-in-via-Supabase requests fail with `Supabase-authed user hit a server without DATABASE_URL configured`. **From Railway, you MUST use Supabase's Session pooler URL (port 5432), not the Direct connection URL** — Direct is IPv6-only and Railway is IPv4-only. Format: `postgresql://postgres.<project-ref>:<password>@aws-X-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres`. Get it from Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Database → Connection string → **Session pooler** tab. Don't use `sslmode=verify-full` on the pooler — drop the param or use `sslmode=require`. See `server/.env.example` for the full rationale. |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | server | Supabase project URL (e.g. `https://<ref>.supabase.co`). When set, `requireAuth` accepts Supabase JWTs alongside legacy Google tokens. Unset = legacy Google-only auth. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | apps/web | Backend URL (default: `http://localhost:3001/api/v1`) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | apps/web | Origin used by `metadataBase` for absolute OG image URLs. Set to the deployed origin (e.g. `https://itinly.vercel.app` or `https://itinly.app`). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | apps/web | Google OAuth client ID for frontend |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | apps/web | Google Maps API key (enables Map tab) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_MAP_ID` | apps/web | Cloud map ID for styled markers (optional; defaults to demo ID) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_ORIGIN` | apps/web | Production origin (e.g. `https://itinly.vercel.app`). Set in Vercel for both **Production and Preview**. Drives the OAuth preview-relay: previews send Google's `redirect_uri` here (the only value Google has registered) and are bounced back via `state.origin`. Leave unset locally. See [docs/vercel-setup.md](docs/vercel-setup.md#oauth-on-preview-deployments). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_PREVIEW_ORIGIN_PATTERN` | apps/web | Anchored regex matching allowed preview origins for the OAuth relay. Set on **Production only** — that's where the relay validates the `state.origin` before bouncing the OAuth code. Mirrors the server's `CORS_ORIGIN_PATTERN`. Include both per-deploy hostnames and any stable preview alias in the alternation. Example: `^(https://itinly-[a-z0-9-]+-justmarks-projects\.vercel\.app\|https://preview\.itinly\.app)$`. |

## Email Processing

The app scans your Gmail for travel confirmation emails and uses Claude AI to extract structured itinerary data.

**How it works:**
1. Click "Scan Emails" from the dashboard or a trip detail page
2. Optionally select a Gmail label to filter (e.g., "Travel") or scan all mail
3. The backend searches Gmail for travel-related keywords (confirmation, booking, reservation, itinerary, e-ticket)
4. Each email body is sent to Claude AI, which extracts segments (flights, hotels, restaurants, activities, etc.) as structured JSON
5. Extracted segments are validated with Zod and auto-matched to existing trips by date
6. Each parsed segment is compared against the existing itinerary and classified as **new**, **duplicate**, **enrichment** (fills empty fields), or **conflict** (disagrees on a non-empty field) so you can review and decide what to apply
7. You review the results, select which segments to add, and assign them to trips
8. Added segments appear with a yellow "Review" badge — click the green checkmark to confirm

**Requirements:**
- Gmail API enabled in your Google Cloud project
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set in `server/.env` (Claude API key from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/))
- User must grant Gmail read permission during OAuth sign-in

**Deduplication and recovery:**
- Processed email IDs are tracked, so re-scanning skips already-handled emails
- Dismissed emails are also skipped on subsequent scans
- Emails that previously failed Zod validation are auto-retried on the next scan
- A "Re-parse previously processed emails" toggle in the scan dialog forces a full re-scan (except for emails already applied to a trip)

## Demo Mode

The app supports a runtime demo mode for trying it without Google credentials. Append `?demo=true` to any URL:

- **Live demo**: [itinly.app/?demo=true](https://itinly.app/?demo=true)
- **Local**: http://localhost:3000/?demo=true

Demo mode uses a mock API client with sample trip data. No backend required. The demo and real login flow are served from the same build — toggle via the URL parameter.

## Conventions

**Times are wall-clock local to the segment's city.** A 09:00 flight out of Tokyo and a 09:00 dinner in Paris are both stored and displayed as `09:00` — the app does not display, convert, or annotate time zones in the UI, even on multi-country trips. This keeps the day-by-day view simple: the time you read is the time you'll see on the clock when you're there.

The one place times are zone-aware is **calendar export**. Both Google Calendar sync and iCal export attach the correct IANA time zone per segment so events land at the right wall-clock time regardless of the user's device zone. For flights, the timezone is derived from the departure / arrival IATA airport code via the static `airport-lookup` table; non-flight segments fall back to the city-name lookup. iCal files include `VTIMEZONE` blocks (with DST transition dates computed via `Intl`) so Outlook and other clients that look up timezone offsets from their own database get the correct summer/winter offset rather than always using standard time. Overnight flights (e.g. LA → Paris) have their `DTEND` advanced to the next calendar day when the arrival UTC time is earlier in the day than the departure UTC time.

## Contributing

All changes go through pull requests — no direct commits to main.

Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
- `feat:` — new feature (bumps minor version)
- `fix:` — bug fix (bumps patch version)
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE` — breaking change (bumps major version)

Version is auto-incremented on merge to main via GitHub Actions. `vercel.json` at the repo root carries an `ignoreCommand` so Vercel skips the no-op build for the auto-generated `chore: bump version ... [skip ci]` commits — only real merges trigger a production deploy.

## Roadmap

**Foundation (shipped):**

- [x] **Phase 1** — Foundation: monorepo, types, Zod schemas, Express API, tests
- [x] **Phase 2** — Core UI: Next.js web app, itinerary table, segment cards, inline editing
- [x] **Phase 3** — Google OAuth: sign-in flow, auth middleware, protected routes
- [x] **Phase 4** — Google Drive storage: per-user Drive persistence, token store, share registry. **(Superseded.)** Storage moved to Supabase Postgres in the migration tracked in [`docs/backend-migration-plan.md`](docs/backend-migration-plan.md); the legacy Drive path is retained today as a coexistence branch for users on the pre-Supabase build and will be removed in Phase 6 of that plan.
- [x] **Phase 5** — Email processing: Gmail scanning + Claude AI parsing, segment match detection, USD cost normalization
- [x] **Phase 6** — UX & export: PDF export (pdfkit), Timeline tab (Hipmunk/Gantt with grouped + chronological views, print-ready), Map tab (Google Maps pins + KML export)
- [x] **Email file import** — paste or upload a saved `.html` or `.eml` message and run it through the same `EmailParser` pipeline (unblocks non-Gmail users)
- [x] **Multi-layout XLSX import** — auto-detects column layouts (B=date vs. C=date, with day-of-month carry-forward for week-grouped workbooks)
- [x] **Debt payoff batch** — Gmail scanner label resolution + body extraction tests, `schemaVersion` on trip JSON, Sentry error tracking, rate limiting on `/emails/scan`
- [x] **Google Calendar sync** — push trip segments to any writable Google Calendar; hotels and car rentals as all-day events; flights/trains carry the correct IANA time zone per city; re-sync updates existing events; unsync removes them; calendar picker lets you choose the target calendar; `calendarId` stored on trip so unsync always hits the right calendar
- [x] **iCal export** — download trip as a `.ics` file named after the trip; VTIMEZONE blocks with DST-aware transitions for Outlook compatibility; overnight flight `DTEND` advanced to next day when UTC arrival precedes UTC departure
- [x] **IATA airport codes for flights** — flight segments carry `departureAirport` / `arrivalAirport` (3-letter IATA) backed by a 1,178-entry shared lookup; render as `City (CODE)` everywhere; segment editor exposes a keyboard-navigable typeahead (search by code, city, airport name, or alias); title auto-fills to `DEP → ARR (Carrier RouteCode)` once both endpoints are set; calendar sync derives the per-leg IANA timezone from the airport code with city-name fallback for legacy data and other transport
- [x] **Trip history audit log** — every mutation to a trip records an append-only entry showing what changed, who, and when. Covers segment create / update (with field-level diff) / delete / confirm, todo lifecycle, share create / revoke, day-city edits, trip-metadata edits, and bulk imports (XLSX + email-apply roll up to one summary entry rather than one per row). Surfaced as a desktop "History" tab and a `/m` overflow-menu bottom sheet. Append-only with a 500-entry cap per trip; visible to owners and contributors; deliberately excluded from the public `/shared/:token` payload so unauthenticated viewers don't see actor emails

**Mobile companion (web PWA at `/m`):**

A mobile-first parallel experience focused on consuming a planned trip rather than re-creating the desktop authoring UX. Lives under `/m/*` in the same Next.js bundle and is auto-served when the viewer hits the desktop URL on a phone.

- [x] **Phase 1 — Foundation** — `MobileFrame` (430px max-width on desktop preview), `/m/login` and `/m` trip list with hero images + country flags + grouped current/upcoming/past sections, `/m/trip` detail with day carousel + segment detail bottom sheet, mobile-aware redirect, share button entry point, mobile user menu with "Use desktop site" override
- [x] **Phase 2 — Costs and Todos** — bottom-sheet for costs (USD-normalised, totals by category) and todos (full CRUD with drag-aware dismissal); pills on the trip header replace a discoverability-poor footer
- [x] **Phase 3 — Offline / PWA** — installable web app (manifest with `start_url: /m`, theme color, iOS standalone meta), hand-rolled service worker that precaches the `/m` shell + Next static chunks (cache-first), runtime-caches trip JSON (network-first → cache fallback) and Wikipedia city images (stale-while-revalidate), React Query cache restored from `localStorage` via `<PersistQueryClientProvider>` so queries don't fire (and fail) before hydration completes — cached trips render immediately on cold offline launch. "Add to Home Screen" entry in the mobile user menu (with iOS-Safari Share-sheet hint as fallback), offline banner in `MobileFrame` driven by `navigator.onLine`. The SW precache uses `fetch` + `cache.put` (not `cache.add`) so redirected responses are re-wrapped without the `redirected` flag — Chromium would otherwise refuse to serve them to a navigation request and fall through to the browser's default offline page. Navigation fallback layers — exact runtime cache → loose match (`ignoreSearch: true`) so query-string variants reuse a cached entry → precached `/m` shell → branded synthetic offline HTML — guarantee the SW always returns a real `Response`, so Chrome's default "You're offline" screen never fires. **Next App Router RSC payload fetches** (the SPA-nav data layer triggered by `<Link>`) are also intercepted: detected via the `text/x-component` Accept header or `?_rsc=` query param, cached network-first, with the `_rsc=` deploy-hash stripped from the cache key so a redeploy doesn't invalidate previously-visited routes. Without this, an offline tap on a previously-viewed trip would silently fail (the SPA fetch can't intercept; Next falls back to a hard nav and the user sees the trip list "refresh"). The trip list reads the React Query cache via `useCachedTripIds` (a `useSyncExternalStore` subscription with a microtask-deferred listener and ref-stable snapshot, so child `useQuery` registrations don't trigger render-during-render warnings) and dims trips that aren't available on this device when offline (with an "Offline — not loaded" badge); tapping one toasts instead of navigating, so the Past section's expanded state survives. The trip detail page detects offline + uncached and renders a dedicated "Not available offline" view with Back + Retry, instead of the generic load error.
- [x] **Phase 4 — Authoring on mobile** — add, edit, and delete segments end-to-end on `/m`. A bottom-sheet form (`MobileSegmentFormSheet`) reuses the desktop `SegmentFormFields` component so the field set, type-specific behaviour, and validation stay identical across surfaces. Per-day "Add" buttons appear on the day-strip carousel and inside each day's section in the All view; the segment detail sheet exposes an "Edit" footer action that hands off to the form sheet (delete lives inside the form sheet's footer). All affordances are gated by `useTripPermission` — owners and shared-edit contributors see them, view-only contributors and public link viewers don't
- [x] **Phase 5 — End-to-end planning on mobile** — trip creation, trip metadata editing, and per-day city editing all live on `/m`. `MobileCreateTripSheet` (title + date range, with overlap-error handling) is reachable from a "+" button in the trip-list header and from the empty-state CTA. `MobileEditTripSheet` (title / start / end / status pills) opens from the trip-detail overflow menu. `MobileEditableCity` is a tap-to-edit affordance shown next to each day's city in both the carousel's active-day header and the All view's per-day sticky headers. Combined with the auto-derive on segment add/edit (city flows from segment → day when sensible), a phone-only user can plan a trip end-to-end without bouncing to desktop
- [x] **Phase 6 — Map and timeline views on `/m`** — `MobileFullMapSheet` overlays a full-screen Google Map with day-filter pills, tap-pin info windows, and an expand button on the existing per-day map preview. `MobileTimelineView` is a Hipmunk/Gantt grid (sticky day-header row + label column, swimlane / chrono toggle, hotel multi-day spans) reachable via a `?v=timeline` URL toggle in the overflow menu. The timeline drops `MobileFrame`'s 430px cap when the device rotates so a landscape phone fits 6+ day columns; portrait fits 3. `extractHotels` / `sortByTime` plus `SEGMENT_CONFIG` / `fmt12h` are extracted to shared utils so desktop and mobile timelines / cards share one source of truth
- [x] **Phase 7 — Email scan + confirm-segment shortcuts** — `MobileEmailScanSheet` runs the Gmail → Claude → review → apply flow as a multi-step bottom sheet (config / scanning / review / done). Reachable from the trip-detail overflow menu (per-trip, pre-filtered to segments matched here) and the mobile user menu (account-level, with a per-row trip selector). The review step renders each parsed segment with a classification badge (new / enrichment / conflict / duplicate), a cycle-through action button (Add / Merge / Replace / Skip), and a default action keyed off the match status. After segments are added with `needsReview: true`, a "**N pending**" pill in the trip-detail header opens `MobileReviewPendingSheet` — per-row green-check confirm plus a "Confirm all" footer (the first UI surface for the existing `useConfirmAllSegments` hook). The Review badge itself becomes tappable on each segment card and inside the detail sheet, so single segments can be cleared without going through Edit → Save
- [x] **Phase 7 polish — Gmail OAuth integration + parity passes** — gates the scan path on `hasGmailLink` (mirroring desktop's split-OAuth flow from PR #202): a `verifying` step probes the labels + pending queries before showing config so a stale `hasGmailLink: true` cache doesn't flash a config screen before bouncing to "Connect Gmail." Mid-flight 403 `GMAIL_SCOPE_REQUIRED` bounces back the same way. Diff'd against the desktop dialog and closed seven parity gaps: pending-results restoration on open, 402 / 503 partial-results banner, default-skip low-confidence segments, server-response apply count, "Scan more" footer button, narrowed `existingSegmentId` to merge / replace, labels-fetch error hint. Empty-trip-target warning + Apply-button gating cover the case where a user with zero trips tries an account-level scan; the all-skip terminal screen distinguishes "dismissed N emails" from "nothing to add"
- [x] **Phase 7 polish — picker + naming UX** — Gmail label picker becomes a dropdown tree on both surfaces (mobile native `<select>`, desktop ShadCN `Select`) with hierarchical indent for nested labels (`Travel/Hotels/Confirmed` reads as a tree). Trip-picker dropdown shows `Title (date range)` so phone-only users can distinguish two trips with similar names
- [x] **Phase 7 polish — new-trip proposals** — when an account-level scan parses segments that don't match any existing trip, cluster them by date proximity (gap > 14 days = separate trip; hotels / cruises bridge the gap via `endDate`) and propose one new trip per cluster. Default name `<Most-common destination> <Month> <Year>` ("Maui April 2026") with a fall-back to "Trip <Month> <Year>" when no city is detectable. Picker shows proposals under a "Create new trip" optgroup; on apply, `useCreateTrip` runs first (sequential, with date-range expansion to cover any manually-rebucketed segment) and the sentinel ids swap for real trip ids before `applyParsedSegments`. Shared util `proposeNewTrips` in `@itinly/shared` so the same clustering can be reused on desktop later
- [x] **Phase 7 polish — server-side deprecation watch** — Anthropic returns model-deprecation warnings via response headers (`anthropic-deprecation-warning` and the standard `Warning: 299 ...`). The parser now surfaces those to Sentry as `warning`-level events with the model tagged, deduped per-process so a deprecated model doesn't generate one event per parsed email. Default model bumped from `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (the one Anthropic flagged) to `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- [x] **Phase 8 — Google Calendar sync on mobile** — `MobileCalendarSyncSheet` reachable from the trip-detail overflow menu mirrors the desktop dropdown's four states (connect-Calendar prompt, calendar picker, synced-info with refresh / remove, and a delete-from-Google vs unlink choice). Shares the `useCalendarSync` hook with desktop so toast copy and behavior stay identical, and the menu label flips to "Calendar synced (N)" once any segment carries a `calendarEventId`

**Remaining mobile work:**

- [ ] **Segment reorder** — drag-to-reorder within a day. Desktop has it via the segment row; mobile needs a long-press-to-grab gesture or a dedicated reorder mode
- [ ] **Suggest meals** dialog — the AI meal-suggestion flow that exists on desktop

**Sharing:**

A trip's owner can publish a read-only or contributor-edit link; recipients open it without signing in (view) or sign in to edit (contributor flow). Backed by a Redis-persisted share registry so links survive server restarts and Railway sleep cycles.

- [x] **Viewer + share creation** — desktop share dialog (`ShareTripDialog`) and mobile share sheet (`MobileShareSheet`); mobile uses `navigator.share` so the OS picks the channel (Messages, Mail, AirDrop, …); recipient lands at `/shared/[token]` (desktop) or `/m/shared` (mobile); per-share toggles for showing costs and todos
- [x] **Server hardening** — `ShareRegistry` self-heal on registry miss (legacy users: rebuilds from the owner's Drive once any owner logs back in; Supabase users: reads the shares array off the trips table); Upstash Redis persistence for `TokenStore` + `ShareRegistry` so refresh tokens and share-token mappings survive process restarts (Supabase-authed users use Postgres-backed `connections` rows instead)
- [x] **Cross-browser demo shares** — demo-mode share tokens are self-describing (`demo:tripId:perm:costs:todos:nonce`) so a recipient on any other browser running `?demo=true` can resolve them from their local sample trips
- [x] **Per-trip unfurl previews** — `ShareSnapshotStore` writes a tiny title/dates snapshot to Redis on share creation; the public `/shared/[token]` page reads it on the Vercel Edge runtime in `generateMetadata` and renders a per-trip Open Graph card
- [x] **Contributor edit flow** — shared trips with `permission: "edit"` show up in the recipient's own trip list with a "shared with you" badge; the recipient can open and edit them in place (writes go to the owner's Postgres rows — Drive for legacy-auth users still on the coexistence branch); read/write access is gated by a `resolveTripAccess(req, tripId, requiredPermission)` helper that checks owner-or-shared-with-edit-permission; `ShareRegistry` keeps an email index keyed on `sharedWithEmail` for fast lookup
- [x] **Recipient self-leave** — a share recipient can remove themselves from a trip without waiting for the owner. Leave action lives on both the trip card (dashboard) and the trip detail page on desktop and mobile. Reuses the existing `DELETE /trips/:id/shares/:shareId` endpoint with the access gate relaxed: owners can revoke any share; non-owners can revoke a share row whose `sharedWithEmail` matches their authenticated email. Writes a `share.leave` audit entry (distinct from owner-initiated `share.revoke`) and pushes a notification to the *owner* ("X left your trip") rather than to the leaver. Anonymous link shares stay owner-only since there's no recipient identity to match
- [x] **Auto-share rules** — owner-scoped rule that auto-shares every existing trip plus every future trip with a given recipient. On rule create, backfills a `TripShare` per existing trip; on trip create, fans out a share to every active rule. Each spawned share carries `originRuleId` so rule edits cascade onto its shares (and only its shares — manual shares to the same recipient stay untouched), and rule delete prompts the owner to choose between keeping existing shares or cascade-revoking them. Conflict policy on backfill is "upgrade only if stricter" (a rule will upgrade view → edit on a manual share, but never downgrade edit → view). One rule per `(owner, recipient)`; self-share rejected. Rule-level activity (create / edit / cascade-delete) collapses into a single push to the recipient instead of N per-share pushes. Surfaced as a dashboard panel on desktop (`AutoShareRulesPanel`) and a bottom sheet on mobile (`MobileAutoShareSheet`); shares originating from a rule render a "Via auto-share rule" pill in the per-trip share dialog so the owner can see at a glance which shares cascade-affect

**Potential ideas for the future:**

- [ ] **Email invites + notifications** — Resend-powered email when a share is created; notifications when a shared trip is updated
- [ ] **Android native** — Expo SDK 55 + React Native; scaffold + Google auth shipped, offline/cached active trip view in progress (no push notifications in v1)
- [ ] **Send to itinly (mobile share target)** — register the PWA as an OS share target so a confirmation email or booking page can be shared from any app (Mail, Gmail, Safari, …) straight into the parser, bypassing the Gmail-scan ceremony for one-off bookings and unblocking non-Gmail mailboxes on the go
- [ ] **Scheduled / auto email import** — opt-in background Gmail scan (e.g. nightly) that parses new confirmations and drops segments into the right trip with `needsReview: true`, so the inbox stays in sync without the user having to remember to run a scan
- [ ] **Places to go** — per-trip list of points-of-interest (shops, museums, viewpoints, neighbourhoods) that aren't tied to a date or time and aren't a todo. Pinnable on the Map tab, groupable by city, and a candidate source for later "schedule this" actions that promote a place into a real segment
- [ ] **Trip overview page** — at-a-glance summary tab: hero image, dates, destinations + flag row, total spend by category, segment counts by type, open todos, pending-review count, share status, and a compact "what's next" card. Becomes the default landing tab on a trip in place of jumping straight to day 1
- [ ] **Calendar sync on shared trips** — today only the trip owner can push segments to a calendar; recipients see the sync button hidden via `useTripPermission().isOwner`. Enabling sync for recipients means each user (owner + every recipient) ends up pushing the same trip to their own Google / Outlook account, and the current storage model (`trip.calendarId` + per-segment `calendarEventId` stored on the trip row) collapses under that — last writer wins, the owner's event ids get clobbered with the recipient's, and the owner's next "update" sync breaks.
  - Real fix: per-(trip, user) sync state. New `trip_user_calendar_sync` table holding `(tripId, userId, calendarId, segmentEventMap)`. Calendar-sync routes read/write keyed by `req.userId` instead of mutating the trip row. UI gate flips from `isOwner` to `canEdit` (or to "any viewer" if we want view-only recipients to push too).
  - Out-of-scope shortcuts considered + rejected: sync-without-persistence (re-syncing creates duplicates within a sync or two), shared event ids (only works for one recipient at a time, awkward for family trips).
  - Worth doing once we have a recipient asking — the schema migration is small but the routes + UI touch every calendar surface.
- [ ] **Account merge** — when a user signed in via Google tries to link a Microsoft identity that's already registered as a *separate* itinly login (today they hit Supabase's "Identity is already linked to another user" and bounce back with an explanation but no merge path), offer to combine the two accounts into one. UX flow:
  1. Detect the conflict at the auth callback; present a choice screen with the two account emails side-by-side, summarising each (trip count, share-rule count, last sign-in).
  2. The user picks: **Merge** (fold the other account into this one + sign in with either provider going forward) or **Leave as-is** (keep them separate; current behaviour).
  3. On merge, migrate the secondary account's data into the primary's user-id: trips, settings, share rules, processed_emails, auto-share rules. Also re-attach the secondary's `email` and `calendar` connection rows to the primary's user-id *only* when the primary doesn't already have a connection of that type (no clobber of a working link).
  4. Update share rows so trips the merged user *owned* now belong to the primary; share rows where the merged user was the *recipient* point at the primary instead (de-dup if both already had a share to the same trip — keep the more permissive permission).
  5. Mark the secondary user-id revoked at Supabase and delete it.
  6. Land on a summary screen: "Linked Microsoft to your Google account. Merged 3 trips (1 overlapped — kept the original), kept 2 auto-share rules, transferred the calendar connection." Per-section counts + a list of any overlap warnings the user should review.
  Real project — multi-table data migration, needs to be transactional, undo-able on failure, and ideally previewable before commit. Worth doing once a clear signal arrives that multi-account users are common.
